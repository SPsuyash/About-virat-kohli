            <h1>THE RUN MACHINE OF WORLD CRICKET</h1>
            <p>Virat Kohli (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian
                international cricketer and the former captain 
                of the Indian national cricket team. He is a 
                right-handed batsman and an occasional medium-fast
                bowler. He currently represents Royal Challengers
                Bangalore in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. 
                Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest 
                batsmen in the history of cricket and the best of 
                the 21st century.
                He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in T20I 
                and IPL, ranks third in ODI, and stands as the 
                fourth-highest in international cricket. He also holds 
                the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket 
                and stands second in the list of most international centuries
                scored. Kohli was a member of the Indian team that won the 
                2011 Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. In 2013,
                Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. 
                In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only 
                Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three 
                formats of the game. He is the first player to score 25,000
                runs in a decade. In 2020, the International Cricket Council
                named him the male cricketer of the decade.</p>
